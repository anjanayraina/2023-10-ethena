Ethena is a platform that allows users to mint USDe with stETH and open an equivalent short ETH perps position on perps exchanges. Here is how the process works:

1) Users mint USDe with stETH, which yields 3-4% annualized.
2) Ethena opens an equivalent short ETH perps position on perps exchanges, which yields 6-8%.
3) The combined long and short position daily yield is sent to an insurance fund.
4) The insurance fund sends the yield to the staking contract every 8 hours
