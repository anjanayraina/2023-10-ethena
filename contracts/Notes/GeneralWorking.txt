Ethena is a platform that provides derivative infrastructure to transform Ethereum into the first crypto-native yield-bearing stablecoin, USDe, which is not reliant on the banking system

Ethena provides a request for quotation (RFQ) of how much USDe can be minted for a stETH amount.
If the user agrees to the price, the user signs the EIP712 signature and submits it to Ethena.
stETH is traded for newly minted USDe at the rate specified by Ethena's RFQ and user's signature.
The stETH is then sent to custodians and delegated to perps exchange, where a USD amount of ETH perps equal to the USDe minted is shorted, creating a delta-neutral position

EIP712 is a signing mechanism where you dont actually use metamask to send the transaction instead its another system of signing transactions
Ethena then sends the transction into the mempool on your behalf if its approved by the minters
